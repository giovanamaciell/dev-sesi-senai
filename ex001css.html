    <h2>Feel Good Inc.</h2>

    <p> City's breaking down on a camel's back <br>
        They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack <br>
        So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see <br>
        You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free</p>

    <h2>Broken</h2>
    <p> There's nothing you can do for them <br>
        They are the force between <br>
        When the sunlight is arising </p>

    <p>Keep your distance, walk away <br>
        Don't take his bait <br>
        Don't you stray, don't fade away <br>
        Watch your step, he's out to get you <br>
        Come what may <br>
        Don't you stray, from the narrow way </p>

    <h2>For the Greater Good of God</h2>
    <p> Please tell me now what life is <br>
        Please tell me now what love is <br>
        Well, tell me now what war is <br>
        Again, tell me what life is </p>
